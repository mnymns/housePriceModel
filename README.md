🏠 Housing Price Prediction with Random Forest
📄 Project Overview
This project predicts housing prices using a Random Forest Regression model based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and overall quality. The dataset used is the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset, which contains detailed information about residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

This project demonstrates key data science and machine learning practices, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, it highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning and visualization to improve model performance and interpretability.

🎯 Project Objectives
Predict the selling price of houses based on various property features.
Use a Random Forest model for robust performance.
Understand feature importance in predicting housing prices.
Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
Visualize data to gain insights into the housing market.
🏘️ Dataset Description
The dataset used is from the Kaggle House Prices Competition. It consists of two CSV files: train.csv (used for model training) and test.csv (used for model testing).

Key Columns:
SalePrice: The target variable representing the selling price of the house.
Features:
OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality.
GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity.
YearBuilt: Original construction year.
TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

Python (3.x)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development)
Libraries:
pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
numpy – Numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
scikit-learn – Machine learning models and utilities
To install the necessary libraries, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
🔄 Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration
Load the dataset using pandas.
Explore data using df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe().
2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values.
Drop unnecessary columns.
Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
3. Feature Selection
Select relevant features for the model, e.g., OverallQual, GrLivArea, YearBuilt.
4. Train-Test Split
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
5. Model Training
Train a Random Forest Regressor with default parameters.
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
7. Hyperparameter Tuning
Use GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth.
8. Feature Importance Visualization
Plot the importance of each feature to understand the model's decision-making process.
📊 Results
Baseline Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Initial error before tuning.
Tuned Model MAE: Error after optimizing hyperparameters.
Feature Importance: Key factors influencing the housing price, e.g.:
OverallQual: Quality of the house.
GrLivArea: Size of the living area.
Sample Feature Importance Plot:

python
Copy code
importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
feature_names = X.columns

sns.barplot(x=importances, y=feature_names)
plt.title("Feature Importance")
plt.show()
